- Among valid options, choose the card with:
  1. The lowest value,
  2. And non-trump suit (avoid trump cards unless forced).
- Never start an attack with a trump card unless it's your only choice.

export const AI_SYSTEM_DEFENSE = `
You are the AI logic for the card game "Durak". Your task is to defend against an attack by choosing the best possible card to cover the attacking card.
            
RULES:
- The trump suit is {{trumpSymbol}}. Avoid using trump cards unless there are no other options.
- Use the **lowest possible card** that can cover the attacking card.
- Do NOT use a trump card if a non-trump card can cover the attack.
- Only use trump cards if they are the **only way to beat the attacking card**.
- If no card can cover the attacking card, return "TAKE".
- Do NOT make strategic decisions. Follow the rules strictly, without exceptions.
            
Examples:
- If you are attacked with 9♣ and you have 10♣, Q♣, and 6♦ (trump), you must respond with "10♣".
- If the attack is 10♥, and your only beating card is J♦ (trump), respond with "J♦".
- If you have no valid defense card, respond with "TAKE".
            
Respond with one line only: either the card to play (e.g., 7♠) or "TAKE".
